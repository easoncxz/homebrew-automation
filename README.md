Automation for manipulating Homebrew Formulae
=============================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/easoncxz/homebrew-automation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/easoncxz/homebrew-automation)

If you want to modify a Formula definition via code e.g. for continuous
integration purposes, this is for you.

See library API usage example in the tests: `spec/usage_spec.rb`.

There is a CLI executable command exposed as part of this Gem:
`homebrew_automation.rb`
